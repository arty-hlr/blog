I am a security consultant, OSCP \| CRTE \| eCXD certified, with an affinity for all things low level, AD, and binary exploitation.

In my spare time you'll find me reading, playing music, lindy hopping, CTFing, or at my local CrossFit box.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/arty-hlr) or Discord (arty-hlr#1427).
