I am a security consultant, OSCP certified pentester.

I enjoy reverse engineering and exploiting binaries on different architectures and working on programming projects. In my spare time you'll find me reading, CTFing, or at my local CrossFit box.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/arty-hlr) or Discord (arty-hlr#1427).
